Application
    rheoTestFoam

Description
    Testing application to be used with library lconstitutiveEquations. This 
    application returns the principal components of the extra-stress tensor,
    given the velocity gradient tensor, which is defined by the user. Two modes
    are available: ramp (several shear-rates evaluated up to steady-state) and
    non-ramp (single shear-rate evaluated over time). The solver manipulates
    internally the BC in order to get the given shear-rate. The mesh to be used
    with this solver is a one-cell unitary cube.
    
    This solver is part of rheoTool.
