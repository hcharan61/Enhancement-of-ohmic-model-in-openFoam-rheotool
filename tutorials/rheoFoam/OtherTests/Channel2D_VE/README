--> Purpose

	The tests in this folder provide a template for the all the viscoelastic models available in reoTool (the Oldroyd-BLog model is already used in the channel tutorial). In order to run the cases without the log-conformation tensor apporach, simply change the constitutiveEq type in the constitutiveProperties dict (remove suffix 'Log' from the name).
	
--> Geometry

	Same as in the Channel tutorial.
	
--> Boundary conditions

	Same as in the Channel tutorial. 
	
--> Fluid properties

	They are model-dependent, except the density. All cases are simulated for Wi = 0.1 and Re = 0.
	
	EXCEPT cases in directory otherModels/
