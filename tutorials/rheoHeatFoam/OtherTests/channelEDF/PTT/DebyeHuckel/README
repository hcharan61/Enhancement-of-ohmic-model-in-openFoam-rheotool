This tutorial exemplifies the use of rheoHeatFoam in an EDF flow. 

The base case is the #channelEDF# tutorial of rheoEFoam. A #heatFlux# BC is applied at the walls, which cools down the 
fluid by external convection. The viscosity and relaxation time of the fluid are temperature sensitive (WLF model for both).

NOTE: none of the eletric-related physical properties of the fluid is sensitive to temperature.
This feature will likely come in a future version.
