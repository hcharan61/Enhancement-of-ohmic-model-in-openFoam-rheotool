--> Purpose

   This case tests the solver for tethered and circular molecules. All molecules are tethered. The molecules in y+ are linear, while the ones
   in y- are circular (they correspond to the linear ones with the last bead connected to the fisrt bead).
   The physical parameters for the linear molecules are typical of lambda-DNA (relaxation time = 4.1 s). The parameters for the circular
   molecules are the same, but they do not model any specific molecule.
   The forcing is analytical and corresponds to a planar extensional flow.
   
   Tethered molecules are more easily stretched (apparent Wi is higher; dt should be low to keep stability).
